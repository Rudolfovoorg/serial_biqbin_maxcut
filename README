Serial BiqBin: an exact solver for Max-Cut problem

INSTALLATION:
Open the makefile Makefile and set the compiler and blas/lapack package correctly
depending on your system. Then type make. BiqBin is self-contained and does not depend
on any outer libraries except for basic linear algebra operations.  

USAGE:
./biqbin instances_file params

where instance_file contains the underlying graph in edge list format and params is the parameter file that comes with the solver. 
   
*****
NOTE: The maximum size of problem the solver can solve is 512. If you need more adjust the number NMAX in biqbin.h file

*****************************************************************
Explanation of BiqBin parameters (default values are in biqbin.h)
*****************************************************************

init_bundle_iter = initial number of iterations of bundle method
max_bundle_iter  = maximum number of iterations of bundle method

min_outer_iter	= minimum number if iterations of cutting planes algorithm
max_outer_iter	= maximum number if iterations of cutting planes algorithm

NOTE: all cutting planes are in the form B(X) <= 1 for appropriate operator B.
violated_TriIneq = violation level of inequalities, i.e.
                   B(X) - 1 > violated_Ineq

TriIneq = maximum number of triangle inequalities to add in each separation
          of new cutting planes. 

Pent_Trials and Hepta_Trials = number of times simulated anneling is run for each type of 
                               corresponding pentagonal or heptagonal inequality.
			       Trials define the maximum number of pentagonal and heptagonal inequalities
                               to add in each separation of new cutting planes. Note that
                               for these numbers it should hold:
                               PentIneq = 3 * Pent_Trials         
                               HeptaIneq = 4 * Hepta_Trials  

include_Pent and include_Hepta = whether to include pentagonal and/or heptagonal inequalities
				 in SDP bound

root:  if set to 1 only the SDP bound at root node will be computed

use_diff:  if set to 1 cutting planes will only be added to SDP bound computation when
           neccessary. This helps traversing the B&B tree faster. 

time limit = maximum number of seconds allowed for the algorithm to run. If 0, biqbin stops
             when optimum solution is found. 

branchingStrategy = select branching strategy:
                    LEAST_FRACTIONAL  0
                    MOST_FRACTIONAL   1

detailedOutput: set to 1 for more detailed output during evaluation of each B&B node
