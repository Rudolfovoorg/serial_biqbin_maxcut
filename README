init_bundle_iter = initial number of iterations of bundle method
max_bundle_iter  = maximum number of iterations of bundle method

min_outer_iter	= minimum number if iterations of cutting planes algorithm
max_outer_iter	= maximum number if iterations of cutting planes algorithm

NOTE: all cutting planes are in the form B(X) <= 1 for appropriate operator B.
violated_TriIneq = violation level of inequalities, i.e.
                   B(X) - 1 > violated_Ineq

TriIneq = maximum number of triangle inequalities to add in each separation
          of new cutting planes. 

Pent_Trials and Hepta_Trials = number of times simulated anneling is run for each type of 
                               corresponding pentagonal or heptagonal inequality.
			       Trials define the maximum number of pentagonal and heptagonal inequalities
                               to add in each separation of new cutting planes. Note that
                               for these numbers it should hold:
                               PentIneq = 3 * Pent_Trials         
                               HeptaIneq = 4 * Hepta_Trials  

include_Pent and include_Hepta = whether to include pentagonal and/or heptagonal inequalities
				 in SDP bound

root:  if set to 1 only the SDP bound at root node will be computed

use_diff:  if set to 1 cutting planes will only be added to SDP bound computation when
           neccessary. This helps traversing the B&B tree faster. 

time limit = maximum number of seconds allowed for the algorithm to run. If 0, biqbin stops
             when optimum solution is found. 

branchingStrategy = select branching strategy:
                    LEAST_FRACTIONAL  0
                    MOST_FRACTIONAL   1

detailedOutput: set to 1 for more detailed output during evaluation of each B&B node
